# DesignPatterns-Javascript

This repo contains design pattern implementations in javascript with examples. 

### Design patterns
Design patterns are reusable solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design.
During any language’s lifespan, many such reusable solutions are made and tested by a large number of developers from that language’s community. It is because of this combined experience of many developers that such solutions are so useful because they help us write code in an optimized way while at the same time solving the problem at hand.

The main benefits we get from design patterns are the following:
- They are proven solutions
- They are easily reusable
- They are expressive
- They prevent the need for refactoring code
- They lower the size of the codebase

### Creational Design Patterns
These patterns deal with object creation mechanisms which optimize object creation compared to a basic approach. 
The basic form of object creation could result in design problems or in added complexity to the design. Creational design patterns solve this problem by somehow controlling object creation. 
Some of the popular design patterns in this category are:
- [Factory](https://github.com/rahulb246/DesignPatterns-Javascript/blob/main/FactoryPattern.js) 
- [Singleton](https://github.com/rahulb246/DesignPatterns-Javascript/blob/main/SingletonPattern.js)
- Builder
- Prototype

### Structural Design Patterns
These patterns deal with object relationships. 
They ensure that if one part of a system changes, the entire system doesn’t need to change along with it. 
The most popular patterns in this category are:
- [Proxy](https://github.com/rahulb246/DesignPatterns-Javascript/blob/main/proxyPattern.js)
- Adapter
- Bridge
- Composite
- Decorator
- Facade

### Behavioral Design Patterns
These types of patterns recognize, implement, and improve communication between disparate objects in a system. They help ensure that disparate parts of a system have synchronized information. 
Popular examples of these patterns are:

- [Strategy](https://github.com/rahulb246/DesignPatterns-Javascript/blob/main/StrategyPattern.js)
- [Iterator](https://github.com/rahulb246/DesignPatterns-Javascript/blob/main/IteratorPattern.js)
- [Mediator](https://github.com/rahulb246/DesignPatterns-Javascript/blob/main/MediatorPattern.js)
- [Observer](https://github.com/rahulb246/DesignPatterns-Javascript/blob/main/observerPattern.js)
- [Visitor](https://github.com/rahulb246/DesignPatterns-Javascript/blob/main/visitorPattern.js)
- Chain of responsibility
- Command
- Memento
State
